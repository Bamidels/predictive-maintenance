This project aims to leverage the PHM08 dataset from NASA’s data repository to predict the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of turbofan engines.

Project Description:

This project aims to leverage the PHM08 dataset from NASA’s data repository to predict the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of turbofan engines. The PHM08 dataset, first introduced in 2008 during a competition at the Prognostics and Health Management conference, is a comprehensive multivariate time series dataset encompassing data from 218 turbofan engines, with each engine's data containing measurements from 21 different sensors. These engines start from a state of normal operation and progressively advance to a point of failure.

The primary goal of the project is to develop a predictive maintenance algorithm that can accurately forecast the RUL of the components in these engines. This involves not only utilizing standard machine learning model development techniques but also integrating an additional critical step – the computation of the RUL values. These computed values are crucial as they serve as a benchmark against which the model's predictions are compared.

By successfully predicting the RUL, the project aims to enhance maintenance strategies, reduce downtime, and improve the safety and reliability of turbofan engines in various applications. This predictive approach stands to offer significant cost savings and efficiency improvements in engine maintenance and management.
